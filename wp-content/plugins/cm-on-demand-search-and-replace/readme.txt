**Search and replace the words, phrases and HTML in real time throughout the content without changing the database.**

This WordPress search and replace tool allows you to easily change the content of posts, pages, comments, titles and excerpts just before they are displayed on the front end, without making changes in the WordPress database.

The mass search and replace tool allows a complete database wide search to replace WordPress text. This is a real-time find and replace tool that applies any number of pre-defined rules after a page is generated by WordPress,
 but before it is sent to a user's browser.
