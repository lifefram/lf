== Description ==
MyKnowledgeBase is a lightweight and mobile-friendly WordPress theme. Personalize your website via the Customizer in your dashboard and by using a custom post or page template. With 2 of the custom page templates you can transform your categories and posts into a knowledge base, FAQ or wiki. It also contains multiple widget areas. Enjoy!


== Installation ==
1. Go to your admin Dashboard > Appearance > Themes.
2. Select and install a new theme from the online WordPress Theme Directory or from your pc (zip file).
3. Once activated, you're ready to use it.

= Set hompepage =
You can choose between the default homepage (displaying posts) and a static page as homepage.

To set a static page as homepage go to your admin Dashboard > Settings > Reading and select the page you want.

= Post and page templates =
While creating a post or page you can choose between default layout (with sidebar) and full width layout. This can be done via the Post or Page Attributes box.

You can personalize your theme via the Customizer in your dashboard.

= Create a knowledge base =
The knowledge base uses the native categories and posts.

Create a new page and select the knowledge base page template. You can choose between 3 columns (with sidebar) and 4 columns (without sidebar). In mobile screens 2 columns.

There's also a field to exclude categories.

Settings for the knowledge base can be found in the Customizer.

== Notes ==
= Translation =
This theme is translation-ready and supports language packs from wordpress.org

= Block Editor and Full Site Editing =
This theme is developed way before the Block Editor and Full Site Editing became part of WordPress.

Theme only has basic support for the block editor. This means that most native blocks look fine in the frontend of your website.

Theme does not support Full Site Editing. And support will not be added in the future.

= Credits =
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this theme, so: thank you!

= Support =
If you have a question or problem while using this theme, please visit the relevant theme page at WordPress.org and open a ticket in support forum.
